# AllStockAnalysis
### Challenge
This analysis is different in the fact that it gives the user the choice to go into VBA and change the stock ticker to whatever desired ticker he wants to analyze for return and totalVolume but similar in structure (albeit shorter). It is imperative he use the same formatted dataset (same named columns) but having as many rows as he wants filled with different stock data.  I also deleted some fluff to make it more concise, though I left all of the conditinal formatting making it easier to see the positive/negative return stocks. This VBA script accommodates any year he wishes to analyze for the stocks he chooses on the datasheet, though the 2017 and 2018 years are on the workbook for functionality purposes. More directions are right above where the "DIM tickers(12) As String" is so he can replace the ticker symbols up to 12 times, anything after that he would have to manually add to "DIM tickers(12+n) As String" as "n" would be how many other more stocks he would like to analyze. It could go up to tickers(1000) but that code would be overflowed most likely and would be way too long as it would interact with the rule of DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
